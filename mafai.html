             3. Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
             4. In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he
                            was project director of the SLV-III, the
                            first satellite launch vehicle that was
                            both designed and produced in India.
                            5. Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                            Kalam planned the program that produced
                            a number of successful missiles, which
                            helped earn him the nickname 
                                “Missile Man.”
                            6. Among those successes
                            was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                            ballistic missile, which incorporated
                            aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                            in 1989.
                            7. He also played a
                            pivotal organisational, technical,
                            and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                            nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                            the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                           8. From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
                            was scientific adviser to the defense
                            minister, and he later served as principal
                            scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                            government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                            9. His prominent role in
                            the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                            solidified India as a nuclear power and
                            established Kalam as a national hero,
                            although the tests caused great concern
                            in the international community.
                            10. In 1998 Kalam put
                            forward a countrywide plan called
                            Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                            as a road map for transforming India from
                            a less-developed to a developed society
                            in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                            other measures, increasing agricultural
                            productivity, emphasizing technology as
                            a vehicle for economic growth, and
                            widening access to health care and
                            education.
